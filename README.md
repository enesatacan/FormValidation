## 🌟 Features  
### 🔍 **Real-Time Validation**  
This project provides instant feedback as users fill out the form, ensuring smooth interaction with the following:  
- **Full Name**: Verifies the input is a valid first and last name.  
- **Phone Number**: Ensures the input is exactly 10 digits and numeric.  
- **Email**: Validates email format using a regular expression.  
- **Message**: Requires a minimum of 30 characters for the message field.  

### 🛠 **Error Messaging**  
- Displays clear and user-friendly error messages when invalid input is detected.  
- Shows success icons (`✔️`) next to fields that pass validation.

## 🖥️ How It Works  

### 🔧 Validation Logic:  
1. **Name Validation**:  
   - Confirms the name is not empty.  
   - Uses a regex to check for a valid first and last name.  

2. **Phone Number Validation**:  
   - Ensures the number is exactly 10 digits long.  
   - Prevents the use of non-numeric characters.  

3. **Email Validation**:  
   - Validates email input to ensure it follows the correct structure using regex.  

4. **Message Validation**:  
   - Checks if the message contains at least 30 characters.  

### 🚦 Submit Button Behavior:  
- Prevents submission if any field is invalid.  
- Displays a warning for 3 seconds, prompting users to fix errors.
